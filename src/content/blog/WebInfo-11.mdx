#  Web Reconnaissance Notes: Fingerprinting

##  What is Fingerprinting?
- Fingerprinting is the process of **extracting technical details** about a website’s underlying infrastructure.
- Like a fingerprint uniquely identifies a person, server and software “signatures” can help identify:
  - Web servers
  - Operating systems
  - CMSs and other web technologies

---

##  Why is Fingerprinting Important?
- **Targeted Attacks**: Identifying software versions enables precise exploitation.
- **Detect Misconfigurations**: Finds default settings, outdated software, weak headers.
- **Target Prioritization**: Focuses efforts on likely vulnerable or high-value systems.
- **Infrastructure Profiling**: Builds a holistic view for informed attack planning.

##  Fingerprinting Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Banner Grabbing** | Pull service banners (e.g., `curl -I`) to reveal server software/version. |
| **HTTP Header Analysis** | Headers like `Server` or `X-Powered-By` can expose tech details. |
| **Probing Specific Responses** | Custom requests can trigger unique errors revealing server/CMS types. |
| **Page Content Analysis** | Inspect HTML structure, metadata, JavaScript files, copyright. |

---

##  Common Fingerprinting Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Wappalyzer** | Browser extension that detects CMS, JS frameworks, analytics, etc. |
| **BuiltWith** | Web-based profiler for detailed tech stack reports. |
| **WhatWeb** | CLI tool with a large signature DB for CMS & plugin detection. |
| **Nmap** | Network scanner; with NSE scripts, can identify services & OS. |
| **Netcraft** | Online tool for tech profiling + security posture. |
| **wafw00f** | Detects presence and type of Web Application Firewalls. |
| **Nikto** | Web scanner for outdated software, misconfigs, and header issues. |

## Case Study: Fingerprinting `inlanefreight.com`

### Banner Grabbing

#### Command:
```bash
curl -I inlanefreight.com
```

#### Output:
```http
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
```

- Redirects to HTTPS → check next hop.

```bash
curl -I https://inlanefreight.com
```
```http
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
```

- Indicates **WordPress is redirecting** to `www.inlanefreight.com`.

```bash
curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com
```
```http
Link: <.../wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
```

- Confirms **WordPress JSON API** is present → clearly a WordPress site.

---

###  WAF Detection (wafw00f)

#### Command:
```bash
wafw00f inlanefreight.com
```

#### Output:
```
[+] The site https://inlanefreight.com is behind Wordfence (Defiant) WAF.
```

- **WAF Detected**: Wordfence by Defiant.
- Implication: May block automated scans or probing.

###  Fingerprinting with Nikto

#### Installation (if needed):
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y perl
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
cd nikto/program && chmod +x ./nikto.pl
```

#### Scan Command:
```bash
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```
- `-Tuning b`: Runs **software identification modules only**.

#### Key Findings:
- **Multiple IPs**: Both IPv4 & IPv6.
- **Server**: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) — **outdated** (latest is 2.4.59+).
- **CMS**: WordPress detected (`/wp-login.php`, `x-redirect-by`, `wp-json`).
- **Headers**:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` → **missing**
  - `X-Content-Type-Options` → **missing**
  - `X-Frame-Options` → deprecated
- **Files Found**:
  - `/license.txt` → potential info disclosure
- **Security Flags**:
  - Accepts **junk HTTP methods**
  - WordPress cookie lacks `httponly`
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - TLS-related config issues
  - Potential exposure to known Apache/WordPress vulnerabilities

##  Summary

| Element | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Server | Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) – outdated |
| CMS | WordPress |
| WAF | Wordfence (Defiant) |
| Issues | Missing headers, outdated software, exposed endpoints (`/wp-login.php`, `/wp-json/`) |
