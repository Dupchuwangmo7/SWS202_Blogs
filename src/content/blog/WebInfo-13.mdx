### **robots.txt – The Website’s Crawler Rulebook**

**Analogy**: Like a "Private – Do Not Enter" sign at a party, `robots.txt` tells web crawlers which parts of a site they can or cannot access.

---

### **What Is `robots.txt`?**
- A **plain text file** located in a website's root directory:  
  `https://example.com/robots.txt`
- Based on the **Robots Exclusion Standard**
- Contains **directives** for web crawlers on where they are allowed or disallowed to crawl

---

### **Structure of robots.txt**
Each **record** includes:
1. **User-agent**: Specifies which bots the rules apply to (e.g., `*`, `Googlebot`)
2. **Directives**: Instructions for the specified user-agent

#### Common Directives:
| Directive      | Purpose                                                | Example                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Disallow`     | Blocks access to specified paths                       | `Disallow: /admin/`                |
| `Allow`        | Grants access to specific paths                        | `Allow: /public/`                  |
| `Crawl-delay`  | Sets delay between requests (in seconds)              | `Crawl-delay: 10`                  |
| `Sitemap`      | Provides URL of the sitemap for efficient crawling     | `Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml` |

---

### **Sample robots.txt**
```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
Allow: /public/

User-agent: Googlebot
Crawl-delay: 10
Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
```

**Interpretation**:
- All bots: No access to `/admin/` and `/private/`, allowed to crawl `/public/`
- Googlebot: Must wait 10 seconds between requests
- Sitemap provided to help search engines crawl efficiently

---

### **Why Crawlers Respect robots.txt**
- **Ethics & Legal**: Ignoring it could breach terms of service or legal boundaries.
- **Performance**: Prevents overloading the web server.
- **Security**: Helps protect sensitive or restricted parts of a website from indexing.

---

### **robots.txt in Web Reconnaissance**
While **not meant for attackers**, this file can reveal valuable intelligence:
- **Hidden Directories**: Disallowed paths may expose locations like `/backup/`, `/staging/`, or `/admin/`
- **Website Structure Mapping**: Shows layout or components not visible in navigation
- **Crawler Traps**: Honeypots designed to catch malicious bots—may indicate defensive security awareness

---

### **Important Notes**
- `robots.txt` is **publicly accessible**.
- It’s **not a security control**—**just a guideline**.
- Malicious bots can **ignore** it entirely.
