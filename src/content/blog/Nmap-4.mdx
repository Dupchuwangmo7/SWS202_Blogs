### Importance of Understanding Scanning

- **Objective**: To gather detailed information about a target system, including:
    - Open ports and their services
    - Service versions
    - Information provided by the services
    - Operating system details

### Port States

Nmap can report six different states for scanned ports:

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **open** | Connection to the scanned port has been established (TCP, UDP, SCTP). |
| **closed** | The port is closed; an RST flag is received in response. |
| **filtered** | Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed due to no response or an error code. |
| **unfiltered** | The port is accessible, but its state (open/closed) cannot be determined (only during TCP-ACK scans). |
| **open | filtered** |
| **closed | filtered** |

### Discovering Open TCP Ports

- **Default Behavior**: Nmap scans the top 1000 TCP ports using a SYN scan (`sS`) when run as root. Otherwise, it defaults to a TCP connect scan (`sT`).
- **Port Specification**: Ports can be defined individually (`p 22,25,80`), in a range (`p 22-80`), or by using predefined options like `-top-ports=10` or `p-` for all ports.

**Example: Scanning Top 10 TCP Ports**

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10

```

**Output**:

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   closed ftp
22/tcp   open   ssh
25/tcp   open   smtp
80/tcp   open   http
110/tcp  open   pop3
139/tcp  filtered netbios-ssn

```

### Packet Tracing

To trace packets sent and received during a scan, use:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping

```

- **Options**:
    - `-packet-trace`: Displays all packets sent and received.
    - `Pn`: Disables ICMP echo requests.
    - `n`: Disables DNS resolution.
    - `-disable-arp-ping`: Disables ARP ping.

### Connect Scan

- **TCP Connect Scan (`sT`)**: Completes the TCP three-way handshake to determine port status.
    - **Advantages**: Highly accurate; determines exact port state.
    - **Disadvantages**: Less stealthy; creates logs on target systems.

**Example: Connect Scan on TCP Port 443**

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT

```

**Output**:

```
PORT STATE SERVICE REASON
443/tcp open https syn-ack

```

### Filtered Ports

- **Filtered State**: Indicates that a firewall may be dropping packets. Nmap retries sending packets to determine the port state.
- **Example of Filtered Port Scan**:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn

```

**Output**:

```
PORT STATE SERVICE
139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn

```

### Discovering Open UDP Ports

- **UDP Scans**: Slower than TCP scans due to the stateless nature of UDP. Nmap sends empty datagrams and may not receive responses.
- **Example: UDP Scan**:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU

```

**Output**:

```
PORT STATE SERVICE
68/udp open|filtered dhcpc
137/udp open netbios-ns

```

### Version Scanning

- **Service Version Detection (`sV`)**: Retrieves additional information about services running on open ports.
- **Example**:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason -sV

```

**Output**:
PORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION
445/tcp open netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 63 Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
