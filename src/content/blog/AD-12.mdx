### Overview of Group Policy
- **Definition**: Group Policy is a Windows feature that allows administrators to manage user and computer settings in a domain environment.
- **Purpose**: It is a powerful tool for configuring security settings, user settings, operating systems, and applications.
- **Security Role**: Properly leveraging Group Policy is crucial for enhancing an organization's security posture.

### Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- **Definition**: A GPO is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to users or computers.
- **Examples of GPO Capabilities**:
  - Establishing different password policies for various account types.
  - Preventing the use of removable media (e.g., USB devices).
  - Enforcing screensaver passwords.
  - Restricting access to certain applications (e.g., cmd.exe, PowerShell).
  - Deploying software across the domain.
  - Running scripts at startup/shutdown or user logon/logoff.

### GPO Structure and Precedence
- **Order of Precedence**:
  1. **Local Group Policy**: Settings defined directly on the host.
  2. **Site Policy**: Policies specific to the enterprise site.
  3. **Domain-wide Policy**: Settings applied across the entire domain.
  4. **Organizational Unit (OU)**: Specific settings for users and computers in designated OUs.
  5. **Nested OU Policies**: Special permissions for objects within nested OUs.

- **Processing Order**: GPOs are processed from the top down, with settings in lower-level OUs taking precedence over those in higher-level OUs.

### Managing Group Policy
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**: Tool for managing GPOs in a domain environment.
- **Default Domain Policy**: Automatically created GPO that applies domain-wide settings.
- **Default Domain Controllers Policy**: Sets baseline security and auditing settings for domain controllers.

### GPO Processing and Refresh Frequency
- **Refresh Interval**: GPO settings are updated every 90 minutes for users and computers, with a 5-minute interval for domain controllers.
- **Manual Update**: Use the command `gpupdate /force` to immediately refresh GPO settings.

### Security Considerations of GPOs
- **Potential for Abuse**: Attackers can exploit GPOs to:
  - Add rights to user accounts.
  - Create local administrator accounts on hosts.
  - Schedule malicious tasks or install malware.
- **Example Attack Path**: Using tools like BloodHound to identify GPOs that can be modified by low-privileged users, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

### Conclusion
- **Importance of Understanding GPOs**: Knowledge of Group Policy is essential for both securing Active Directory and identifying potential attack vectors.
- **Next Steps**: Practical exploration of Active Directory objects, Group Policy, and security configurations.
