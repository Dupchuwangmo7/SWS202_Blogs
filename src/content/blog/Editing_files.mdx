### **Editing Files in Linux – Notes**

---

### **1. Introduction to Editing Files**

- After creating files and directories, the next step is to edit and modify them.
- Common text editors in Linux:
    - **Nano** (easy to use, beginner-friendly).
    - **Vim** (powerful, efficient, but requires practice).

---

### **2. Editing with Nano**

- **Nano** is a simple terminal-based text editor.
- To open and edit a file:
    
    ```bash
    nano <filename>
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```bash
    nano notes.txt
    ```
    
- **Basic Nano Commands:**
    - `CTRL + W` → Search for text.
    - `CTRL + O` → Save file.
    - `CTRL + X` → Exit Nano.
    - `CTRL + K` → Cut text.
    - `CTRL + U` → Paste text.

- **Viewing File Contents in Shell:**
    
    ```bash
    cat notes.txt
    ```

---

### **3. Important System Files**

- **`/etc/passwd`** → Contains user details (username, UID, GID, home directory).
- **`/etc/shadow`** → Stores password hashes (restricted access).
- Misconfigured permissions on these files can create security risks.

---

### **4. Editing with Vim**

- Vim (Vi IMproved) is a powerful and highly configurable text editor.
- It follows the **Unix philosophy**: small specialized programs working together.
- To open Vim:
    
    ```bash
    vim <filename>
    ```
    
- **Vim has different modes:**
    - **Normal Mode** → Default mode for running commands.
    - **Insert Mode** → Allows text input (`i` or `a` to enter insert mode).
    - **Visual Mode** → Used for selecting and manipulating text.
    - **Command Mode** → Used for executing commands (`:` key).
    
- **Basic Vim Commands:**
    - `:q` → Exit Vim.
    - `:wq` → Save and exit.
    - `:q!` → Quit without saving.
    - `i` → Enter insert mode.
    - `ESC` → Return to normal mode.

- To start the tutorial:
    
    ```bash
    vimtutor
    ```

- **Estimated time to complete**: 25-30 minutes.

### **Conclusion**

- Nano is easier for quick edits, while Vim is more efficient for advanced users.
- Understanding permissions and system files is crucial for security.
- Learning Vim can significantly improve text editing speed in Linux.
