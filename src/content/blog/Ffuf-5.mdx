### Recursive Fuzzing with Ffuf

#### Introduction to Recursive Fuzzing
Recursive fuzzing is an advanced technique that automates the process of scanning for directories and files within newly identified subdirectories. This method is particularly useful for websites with complex directory structures, allowing you to efficiently explore all levels of a web application without manually specifying each directory.

#### Benefits of Recursive Fuzzing
- **Automation**: Automatically scans newly discovered directories, saving time and effort.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures that all subdirectories and their contents are explored.
- **Depth Control**: Allows you to specify a maximum depth for the scan, preventing overly deep scans that could take a long time.

#### Recursive Flags in Ffuf
To enable recursive scanning in ffuf, you can use the following flags:
- **`-recursion`**: Enables recursive scanning.
- **`-recursion-depth <depth>`**: Specifies the maximum depth to scan. For example, `-recursion-depth 1` will only scan the main directories and their immediate subdirectories.
- **`-e <extension>`**: Specifies the file extension to look for (e.g., `.php`).

Additionally, using the `-v` flag will output the full URLs, making it easier to understand the structure of the discovered resources.

#### Example Command for Recursive Fuzzing
To perform a recursive fuzzing scan, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v
```

#### Understanding the Output
When you run the recursive fuzzing command, you will see output that includes the status of each request and the URLs being tested. For example:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\ \ \_\ \ \____/ \ \_\
\/_/ \/_/ \/___/ \/_/

```

- **Status Codes**: The output will show the HTTP status codes for each request. A **200 OK** indicates that the resource exists, while a **301 Moved Permanently** indicates a redirect.
- **New Jobs**: The line `[INFO] Adding a new job to the queue` indicates that ffuf has discovered a new directory and is queuing it for further scanning.

#### Performance Considerations
- **Request Volume**: Recursive fuzzing can significantly increase the number of requests sent to the server, so be mindful of the potential impact on the target.
- **Depth Control**: Specifying a recursion depth helps manage the scan's duration and prevents overwhelming the server with requests.

### Conclusion
Recursive fuzzing with ffuf is a powerful technique for exploring complex web applications. By automating the discovery of directories and files, you can efficiently identify hidden resources across multiple levels of a website. This method enhances your reconnaissance capabilities and allows for a more thorough assessment of web application security.
