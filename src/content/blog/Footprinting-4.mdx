# Cloud Resources Notes

## Core Concept
Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure) have become essential components of modern company infrastructure, but misconfigured resources can create security vulnerabilities despite the provider's secure infrastructure.

## Common Cloud Storage Vulnerabilities
- Improperly configured S3 buckets (AWS), blobs (Azure), or cloud storage (GCP) may allow unauthenticated access
- DNS records often reveal cloud storage used for administrative purposes

## Discovery Methods

### DNS Analysis
- Cloud storage endpoints often appear in DNS records for administrative convenience
- Example found during enumeration: `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

### Google Dorking
- Using advanced search operators like `inurl:` and `intext:` to discover cloud resources
- Search can reveal documents (PDFs, text files, presentations, code) stored in cloud storage

### Source Code Analysis
- Company websites often reference cloud storage in source code
- Cloud resources commonly host images, JavaScript, CSS, and other web assets

### Third-Party Intelligence Tools
- **Domain.glass**: Provides information about infrastructure and security measures
- **GrayHatWarfare**: Specialized search for AWS, Azure, and GCP storage with filtering capabilities
  - Can identify publicly accessible files by format
  - Helps discover content after initial identification

### Search Strategies
- Use company name abbreviations which are commonly used in IT infrastructure naming
- Search for specific file types that might contain sensitive information
- Look for leaked credentials, especially SSH keys

## Security Risks
- Publicly accessible cloud storage may contain sensitive documents
- Employee mistakes under pressure can lead to serious security breaches
- SSH private keys exposed in public repositories or storage can grant unauthorized system access

## Best Practices for Testing
- Document all discovered cloud resources
- Check for publicly accessible sensitive files
- Verify if authentication is properly implemented
- Test for common misconfigurations in cloud services
