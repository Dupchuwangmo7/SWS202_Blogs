# Notes on SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

**Overview of SNMP**

- **Definition**: SNMP is a protocol used for monitoring and managing network devices, including routers, switches, servers, and IoT devices. It allows for remote configuration and control of these devices.
- **Current Version**: The latest version is SNMPv3, which enhances security but also increases complexity.

**Communication Mechanism**

- **Ports**:
  - **UDP Port 161**: Used for SNMP commands and queries.
  - **UDP Port 162**: Used for SNMP traps, which are unsolicited notifications sent from the server to the client.

- **Client-Server Model**: 
  - The client (SNMP manager) requests information from the server (SNMP agent).
  - SNMP traps allow the server to send alerts to the client without a request.

**Management Information Base (MIB)**

- **Definition**: MIB is a standardized format for storing device information, allowing SNMP to work across different manufacturers.
- **Structure**: MIBs are organized in a hierarchical tree structure and contain Object Identifiers (OIDs) that uniquely identify SNMP objects.
- **OID**: A sequence of numbers that represents a node in the MIB hierarchy, allowing for structured data retrieval.

**SNMP Versions**

1. **SNMPv1**:
   - First version, widely used in small networks.
   - Lacks authentication and encryption, making it vulnerable to interception.

2. **SNMPv2**:
   - Introduced community-based security (SNMPv2c).
   - Still lacks encryption, with community strings transmitted in plaintext.

3. **SNMPv3**:
   - Introduces enhanced security features, including authentication and encryption.
   - More complex configuration compared to previous versions.

**Community Strings**

- **Definition**: Community strings act as passwords that determine access to SNMP data.
- **Security Risk**: If community strings are transmitted in plaintext, they can be intercepted, leading to unauthorized access.

**Default Configuration**

- **Configuration File**: Commonly found in `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`.
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```bash
  sysLocation Sitting on the Dock of the Bay
  sysContact Me <me@example.org>
  rocommunity public default -V systemonly
  ```

**Dangerous Settings**

- **Settings that pose security risks**:
  - `rwuser noauth`: Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.
  - `rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`: Allows access to the full OID tree from any source.

**Footprinting the Service**

- **Ports**: 
  - SNMP typically uses ports 161 (commands) and 162 (traps).
  - SNMPv3 uses ports 993 (IMAPS) and 995 (POP3S) for encrypted communication.

- **Nmap Scanning**: Use Nmap to identify open SNMP ports and services.
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -p161,162
  ```

- **Example Nmap Output**: Displays open ports and service versions, including SSL certificate details.

**SNMP Tools**

- **snmpwalk**: Used to query OIDs and retrieve information.
  ```bash
  snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
  ```

- **onesixtyone**: A tool for brute-forcing community strings.
  ```bash
  onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128
  ```

- **braa**: Used to brute-force OIDs and enumerate information.
  ```bash
  braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*
  ```

**Conclusion**

- SNMP is a powerful tool for network management but poses significant security risks if not properly configured. Understanding its operation, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices for securing SNMP is crucial for network administrators and security professionals. Setting up a local SNMP server for experimentation can provide valuable insights into its configuration and management.
