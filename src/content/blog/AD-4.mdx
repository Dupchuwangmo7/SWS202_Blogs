### Active Directory Objects Notes

#### Definition of Objects
- **Object**: Any resource present within an Active Directory (AD) environment, including users, organizational units (OUs), printers, domain controllers, etc.

#### Types of Active Directory Objects

1. **Users**
   - **Description**: Represents individuals within the organization.
   - **Type**: Leaf object (cannot contain other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Includes display name, last login time, email address, account description, and more. There can be over 800 possible attributes.
   - **Security Principal**: Has a Security Identifier (SID) and a Global Unique Identifier (GUID).
   - **Importance**: Targeted by attackers; access to even low-privileged users can lead to significant enumeration of the domain.

2. **Contacts**
   - **Description**: Represents external users (e.g., vendors, customers).
   - **Type**: Leaf object (cannot contain other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Includes first name, last name, email address, telephone number, etc.
   - **Security Principal**: Not a security principal (no SID, only a GUID).

3. **Printers**
   - **Description**: Represents printers accessible within the AD network.
   - **Type**: Leaf object (cannot contain other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Includes printer name, driver information, port number, etc.
   - **Security Principal**: Not a security principal (no SID, only a GUID).

4. **Computers**
   - **Description**: Represents any computer joined to the AD network (workstations or servers).
   - **Type**: Leaf object (cannot contain other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Similar to user objects, including SID and GUID.
   - **Importance**: Targeted by attackers; administrative access can grant significant rights.

5. **Shared Folders**
   - **Description**: Points to a shared folder on a specific computer.
   - **Type**: Leaf object (cannot contain other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Includes name, location, and security access rights.
   - **Security Principal**: Not a security principal (no SID, only a GUID).

6. **Groups**
   - **Description**: A container object that can hold other objects (users, computers, groups).
   - **Type**: Security principal (has a SID and a GUID).
   - **Attributes**: Includes name, description, membership, and nested groups.
   - **Importance**: Used to manage permissions and access to resources. Nested groups can lead to unintended rights.

7. **Organizational Units (OUs)**
   - **Description**: A container for storing similar objects for administrative ease.
   - **Type**: Container object (can hold other objects).
   - **Attributes**: Includes name, members, and security settings.
   - **Importance**: Useful for delegating administrative tasks and managing Group Policy settings.

8. **Domain**
   - **Description**: The structure of an AD network containing objects like users and computers.
   - **Attributes**: Each domain has its own database and policies.
   - **Importance**: Policies can be set to manage access and security within the domain.

9. **Domain Controllers (DCs)**
   - **Description**: The servers that handle authentication requests and control access to resources.
   - **Importance**: Validate access requests and enforce security policies.

10. **Sites**
    - **Description**: A set of computers across one or more subnets connected by high-speed links.
    - **Importance**: Used to optimize replication across domain controllers.

11. **Built-in**
    - **Description**: A container that holds default groups in an AD domain.
    - **Importance**: Predefined when an AD domain is created.

12. **Foreign Security Principals (FSPs)**
    - **Description**: Objects created to represent security principals from a trusted external forest.
    - **Attributes**: Holds the SID of the foreign object.
    - **Importance**: Facilitates access to resources across trusted domains.

### Key Takeaways
- Active Directory objects are essential components that facilitate resource management and security within an organization.
- Understanding the different types of objects and their attributes is crucial for effective administration and security practices.
- Users, computers, and groups are particularly important for managing access and permissions, making them prime targets for attackers.
