  Linux uses file descriptors and redirections to control data flow between commands, files, and devices.

### Why Understanding File Descriptors Matters?

- Linux offers powerful I/O management through file descriptors
- Understanding redirection helps create efficient command pipelines
---

### 1. File Descriptors (FD) in Linux

A **file descriptor** is a reference used by the operating system to manage I/O operations.
Linux maintains three standard file descriptors:

- **STDIN (0)** - Standard Input: Used for reading input
- **STDOUT (1)** - Standard Output: Used for displaying output
- **STDERR (2)** - Standard Error: Used for displaying error messages

These default file descriptors are used in every process and can be redirected.
---

### 2. Examples of File Descriptors in Action

**STDIN and STDOUT Example (using cat)**

```bash
cat
```

Input: Type some text (e.g., "SOME INPUT") and hit ENTER.
Output: The input will be echoed back to the terminal as standard output.

**STDOUT and STDERR Example (using find)**

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow
```

STDOUT: Displays search results (files found).
STDERR: Shows errors like "Permission denied" when attempting to access restricted directories.

You can suppress the error output by redirecting STDERR to /dev/null:

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
```
---

### 3. Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR

**Redirecting STDOUT to a File**: Save results to a file instead of displaying them:

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
```

**Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to Separate Files**:

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt
```
---

### 4. Redirecting STDIN

You can redirect standard input (STDIN) using the less-than sign (<):

```bash
cat < stdout.txt
```

This command reads the contents of stdout.txt as input for the cat command.
---

### 5. Appending STDOUT to a File

If you want to append STDOUT to an existing file (instead of overwriting it):

```bash
find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
```
---

### 6. Redirecting STDIN Stream to a File

You can use << to stream input directly into a file:

```bash
cat << EOF > stream.txt
Some input data
EOF
```

This will write "Some input data" to stream.txt.
---

### 7. Using Pipes (|) for Redirection

Pipes allow you to pass the output of one command as the input to another command.

**Filter STDOUT using grep**:

```bash
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd
```

**Count the number of results using wc**:

```bash
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```

Here, the output of find is passed through grep to filter for "systemd", and then the result is passed to wc to count the lines.
