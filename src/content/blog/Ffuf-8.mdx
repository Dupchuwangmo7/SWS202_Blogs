### Vhost Fuzzing with Ffuf

#### Understanding Vhosts
- **Vhosts (Virtual Hosts)**: A virtual host allows multiple domain names to be served from a single IP address. This means that a single server can host multiple websites, each accessible via its own domain or sub-domain.
- **Difference from Sub-domains**: While sub-domains are part of a larger domain and may have their own DNS records, Vhosts are served from the same server and may or may not have public DNS records. This makes Vhost fuzzing a useful technique for discovering hidden or non-public sub-domains.

#### Why Use Vhost Fuzzing?
When sub-domains do not have public DNS records, traditional sub-domain fuzzing will not reveal them. Vhost fuzzing allows you to test for these hidden resources by manipulating the `Host` header in HTTP requests. This way, you can identify both public and non-public sub-domains that share the same IP address.

#### Performing Vhost Fuzzing
To perform Vhost fuzzing with ffuf, you will need:
1. **A Wordlist**: A list of common sub-domain names to test against the target domain.
   - For this example, we will use the wordlist located at `/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`.

2. **A Target Domain**: The domain you want to test for Vhosts.
   - In this case, we will use `academy.htb`.

#### Running the Vhost Fuzzing Command
You can run the following command to perform Vhost fuzzing:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H "Host: FUZZ"
```

#### Example Output
When you run the command, you may see output similar to this:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/

```

#### Analyzing the Output
- **Response Codes**: All responses return a **200 OK** status, indicating that the requests were successful. However, since we are changing the `Host` header, we expect to see different response sizes for valid Vhosts.
- **Identifying Valid Vhosts**: If a Vhost exists and is correctly specified in the `Host` header, the response size may differ from the default response size (900 bytes in this case). This indicates that the server is serving a different page for that Vhost.

### Conclusion
Vhost fuzzing is a powerful technique for discovering hidden sub-domains and virtual hosts that may not be publicly accessible. By manipulating the `Host` header in HTTP requests, you can identify both public and non-public resources hosted on the same server. This method enhances your reconnaissance capabilities and can lead to the discovery of valuable information or vulnerabilities within a web application.
