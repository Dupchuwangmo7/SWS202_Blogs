## Linux Structure

- Linux is an operating system (OS) like Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
- It manages hardware resources and enables communication between software and hardware.
- Linux comes in multiple distributions (distros) tailored to different needs.

## History

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Year", "Event"],
    rows: [
      ["1970", "Unix OS developed by Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie at AT&T."],
      ["1977", "BSD released but faced legal issues due to Unix code."],
      ["1983", "Richard Stallman launched the GNU project with the GNU GPL."],
      ["1991", "Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel."],
      ["Present", "Linux now powers desktops, servers, Android, and embedded systems."]
    ]
  }}
/>

## Linux Philosophy

- **Everything is a file** – Even devices and settings are treated as files.
- **Small, single-purpose programs** – Each program is designed for a specific task.
- **Programs can be combined** – Chaining tools together using pipes.
- **Avoid captive user interfaces** – Command-line interfaces are preferred.
- **Configuration in text files** – Easy to read and edit, e.g., `/etc/passwd`.

## Linux Components

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Component", "Description"],
    rows: [
      ["Bootloader", "Manages booting (e.g., GRUB)."],
      ["Kernel", "Core that controls hardware."],
      ["Daemons", "Background services."],
      ["Shell", "Command-line interface (e.g., Bash)."],
      ["Graphics Server", "Handles GUIs (e.g., X-server)."],
      ["Window Manager", "Desktop environment (e.g., GNOME)."],
      ["Utilities", "System tools for everyday tasks."]
    ]
  }}
/>

## Linux Architecture

1. **Hardware** – Physical devices like CPU, RAM, etc.
2. **Kernel** – Manages memory, devices, processes.
3. **Shell** – Lets users interact via command-line.
4. **System Utility** – Offers core functionality and tools.

## Linux File System Hierarchy

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Directory", "Purpose"],
    rows: [
      ["/", "Root directory of the system."],
      ["/bin", "Essential binaries (commands)."],
      ["/boot", "Bootloader and kernel files."],
      ["/dev", "Device files."],
      ["/etc", "System configuration files."],
      ["/home", "User directories."],
      ["/lib", "Shared libraries for booting."],
      ["/media", "Mount point for USBs/CDs."],
      ["/mnt", "Temporary mount point."],
      ["/opt", "Third-party optional software."],
      ["/root", "Root user’s home directory."],
      ["/sbin", "System binaries for admins."],
      ["/tmp", "Temporary files."],
      ["/usr", "User programs and libraries."],
      ["/var", "Variable files like logs and mail."]
    ]
  }}
