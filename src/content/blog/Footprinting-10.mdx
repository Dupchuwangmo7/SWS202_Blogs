# Notes on SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

**Overview of SMTP**

- **Definition**: SMTP is a protocol used for sending emails across an IP network. It can operate between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers.
- **Client-Server Model**: SMTP functions as a client-server protocol, allowing communication between clients and servers, as well as between SMTP servers.

**Ports Used by SMTP**

- **Default Port**: SMTP servers typically accept connections on **port 25**.
- **Alternative Ports**:
  - **TCP Port 587**: Used for sending mail from authenticated users/servers, often with STARTTLS for encryption.
  - **TCP Port 465**: Sometimes used for encrypted connections.

**Connection and Authentication**

- **Connection Process**: 
  - The client authenticates with a username and password before sending emails.
  - The client sends sender and recipient addresses, email content, and other parameters.
  - After transmission, the connection is terminated.

- **Encryption**: SMTP operates unencrypted by default, transmitting data in plaintext. To secure data, it is often used with SSL/TLS encryption.

**SMTP Functionality**

- **Spam Prevention**: SMTP servers implement authentication mechanisms to allow only authorized users to send emails, often using ESMTP with SMTP-Auth.
- **Mail Transfer Process**:
  - **Mail User Agent (MUA)**: The client that sends the email.
  - **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: Software that sends and receives emails, checking for size and spam.
  - **Mail Submission Agent (MSA)**: Validates the email's origin, also known as a relay server.
  - **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)**: Transfers the email to the recipient's mailbox.

**Disadvantages of SMTP**

1. **Delivery Confirmation**: SMTP does not provide a usable delivery confirmation; it typically returns only error messages.
2. **Lack of Authentication**: Users are not authenticated upon connection, leading to potential misuse, such as open SMTP relays being exploited for spam (mail spoofing).

**Security Techniques**

- **DomainKeys (DKIM)** and **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** are used to validate email traffic and protect against spam.
- **Extended SMTP (ESMTP)**: An extension of SMTP that supports TLS for secure connections.

**Default Configuration**

- **Configuration File**: Commonly found in `/etc/postfix/main.cf`.
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```bash
  smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server
  myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
  mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
  inet_protocols = ipv4
  ```

**SMTP Commands**

- **AUTH PLAIN**: Authenticates the client.
- **HELO/EHLO**: Starts the session.
- **MAIL FROM**: Specifies the sender's email address.
- **RCPT TO**: Specifies the recipient's email address.
- **DATA**: Initiates email transmission.
- **QUIT**: Terminates the session.

**Interacting with SMTP Server**

- **Using Telnet**: 
  ```bash
  telnet 10.129.14.128 25
  ```

- **Example Session**:
  ```bash
  EHLO inlanefreight.htb
  MAIL FROM: <cry0l1t3@inlanefreight.htb>
  RCPT TO: <mrb3n@inlanefreight.htb>
  DATA
  From: <cry0l1t3@inlanefreight.htb>
  To: <mrb3n@inlanefreight.htb>
  Subject: Test Email
  ```

**Dangerous Settings**

- **Open Relay Configuration**: 
  ```bash
  mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
  ```
  - This allows any IP address to send emails through the server, which can be exploited for spam.

**Footprinting the Service**

- **Nmap Scanning**: Use Nmap to identify SMTP server capabilities and check for open relay configurations.
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
  ```

- **Example Output**: Indicates whether the server is an open relay and lists tests performed.

**Conclusion**

- SMTP is a fundamental protocol for email transmission, but it requires careful configuration to prevent misuse and ensure security. Understanding its operation and potential vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining a secure email environment.
