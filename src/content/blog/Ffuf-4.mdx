### Page Fuzzing with Ffuf

#### Introduction to Page Fuzzing
Page fuzzing is a technique used to discover hidden pages on a web server by testing various filenames and extensions. This process is particularly useful when you have access to a directory but cannot see any links or pages.

#### Extension Fuzzing
In the previous section, we identified that the `/blog` directory returned an empty page. To find hidden pages within this directory, we will use extension fuzzing to test common file extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.html`, `.aspx`) to see if any files exist.

#### Identifying File Extensions
1. **Server Type**: One way to guess the file extensions is by checking the server type through HTTP response headers. For example:
   - Apache servers often use `.php`.
   - IIS servers may use `.asp` or `.aspx`.
   
   However, this method can be impractical, so we will use ffuf to automate the process.

2. **Using Ffuf for Extension Fuzzing**:
   - We will use a wordlist containing common file extensions. The following command specifies the wordlist for extensions:
   ```bash
   ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ
   ```

3. **Targeting the Index File**:
   - Instead of fuzzing for arbitrary filenames, we will target the common `index.*` file. We will place the `FUZZ` keyword where the extension would be:
   ```bash
   ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/index.FUZZ
   ```

#### Running the Fuzzing Command
When you run the command, you will see output similar to the following:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\ \ \_\ \ \____/ \ \_\
\/_/ \/_/ \/___/ \/_/

```

- **Response Codes**: The output shows the status codes for each request. A **200 OK** response indicates that the resource exists, while a **403 Forbidden** indicates access is denied.
- **Identifying Extensions**: In this case, the `.php` extension returned a **200 OK**, indicating that the website runs on PHP.

#### Fuzzing for Page Filenames
Now that we know the website uses PHP, we can fuzz for specific page filenames using the same wordlist we used for directory fuzzing. We will place the `FUZZ` keyword where the filename should be, and append `.php`:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php
```

#### Example Output
When you run the command, you might see output like this:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
