# Domain Information Notes

## Core Concepts
Domain information gathering is essential for penetration testing - it focuses on understanding a company's entire internet presence, not just subdomains.

## Information Gathering Approach
- **Passive reconnaissance**: Gather data without direct scanning to remain undetected
- Understand company's services to determine technical requirements and likely infrastructure
- Use the enumeration principles: observe what you see and what you don't see

## Key Information Sources

### 1. SSL Certificates
- Examine certificates from main websites which often include multiple subdomains
- Use Certificate Transparency logs via `crt.sh` to find additional subdomains

### 2. Identifying Internet-Accessible Hosts
- Filter discovered subdomains to find company-hosted servers (not third-party)
- Generate IP address lists for further investigation

### 3. Shodan Intelligence
- Search for discovered IPs to find:
  - Open ports and services
  - Geographic location
  - Organization information
  - Security configurations (SSL versions, etc.)

### 4. DNS Records Analysis
- **A records**: Direct hostname to IP mapping
- **MX records**: Mail server information
- **NS records**: Nameserver information (can reveal hosting provider)
- **TXT records**: Often reveal third-party services and verification information

## Interpreting Third-Party Services
Information from DNS records can reveal company infrastructure:
- Atlassian: Software development and collaboration tools
- Google/Gmail: Email management, potential GDrive resources
- LogMeIn: Centralized remote access management
- Mailgun: Email APIs and SMTP services (potential API vulnerabilities)
- Outlook/Office 365: Document management, potential OneDrive/Azure storage
- INWX: Domain registrar/hosting provider

## Best Practices
- Document all discovered subdomains, IPs, and services
- Note third-party providers for later investigation
- Use multiple information sources to build a comprehensive picture
- Identify which hosts are in-scope for testing (avoid third-party services without permission)
