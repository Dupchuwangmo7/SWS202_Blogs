### Active Directory Terminology Notes

#### Key Terms and Definitions

1. **Object**: 
   - Any resource in Active Directory (AD), such as users, computers, printers, domain controllers, and organizational units (OUs).

2. **Attributes**: 
   - Characteristics associated with an object. For example, a computer object has attributes like hostname and DNS name. Each attribute has an LDAP name (e.g., `displayName` for Full Name).

3. **Schema**: 
   - The blueprint of the AD environment, defining object types and their attributes. It includes classes (e.g., "user," "computer") and their required/optional attributes.

4. **Domain**: 
   - A logical grouping of objects (computers, users, OUs, groups). Domains can operate independently or be connected via trust relationships.

5. **Forest**: 
   - A collection of AD domains, serving as the topmost container. It can contain multiple domains and operates independently, with possible trust relationships with other forests.

6. **Tree**: 
   - A collection of AD domains starting from a root domain. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with others, forming parent-child trust relationships.

7. **Container**: 
   - Objects that hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory hierarchy.

8. **Leaf**: 
   - Objects that do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the hierarchy.

9. **Global Unique Identifier (GUID)**: 
   - A unique 128-bit value assigned to every AD object, ensuring uniqueness across the enterprise. Stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute.

10. **Security Principals**: 
    - Entities that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, and processes running in user or computer contexts.

11. **Security Identifier (SID)**: 
    - A unique identifier for a security principal or group, issued by the domain controller. Each SID is unique and cannot be reused.

12. **Distinguished Name (DN)**: 
    - The full path to an object in AD (e.g., `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`).

13. **Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)**: 
    - A single component of the DN that uniquely identifies an object at its current level (e.g., `bjones`).

14. **sAMAccountName**: 
    - The user's logon name, which must be unique and 20 characters or fewer.

15. **userPrincipalName**: 
    - Another way to identify users in AD, formatted as `username@domain`.

16. **FSMO Roles**: 
    - Flexible Single Master Operation roles that manage specific tasks in AD to prevent conflicts. There are five roles: Schema Master, Domain Naming Master, RID Master, PDC Emulator, and Infrastructure Master.

17. **Global Catalog (GC)**: 
    - A domain controller that stores copies of all objects in an AD forest, allowing for object searches across domains.

18. **Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)**: 
    - A DC with a read-only AD database, reducing replication traffic and preventing unauthorized changes.

19. **Replication**: 
    - The process of updating and transferring AD objects between domain controllers to ensure synchronization.

20. **Service Principal Name (SPN)**: 
    - Uniquely identifies a service instance for Kerberos authentication.

21. **Group Policy Object (GPO)**: 
    - A collection of policy settings applied to user and computer objects, identified by a unique GUID.

22. **Access Control List (ACL)**: 
    - An ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that define permissions for an object.

23. **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**: 
    - Individual entries in an ACL that specify access rights for a trustee (user or group).

24. **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**: 
    - Defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an object.

25. **System Access Control Lists (SACL)**: 
    - Logs access attempts to secured objects.

26. **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: 
    - The complete name for a specific computer or host, used to locate objects in AD (e.g., `DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`).

27. **Tombstone**: 
    - A container for deleted AD objects, retained for a specified period (Tombstone Lifetime) before permanent deletion.

28. **AD Recycle Bin**: 
    - Introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2, it allows for the recovery of deleted AD objects without restoring from backups.

29. **SYSVOL**: 
    - A shared folder that stores public files in the domain, such as Group Policy settings and scripts.

30. **AdminSDHolder**: 
    -
