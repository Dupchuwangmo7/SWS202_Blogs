# Enumeration Methodology Notes

## Core Concept
Enumeration methodology provides a structured approach to penetration testing with flexibility to adapt to different environments. It's organized into 6 layers representing boundaries to overcome during testing.

## Three Enumeration Levels
- Infrastructure-based enumeration
- Host-based enumeration 
- OS-based enumeration

## The Six Layers

### Layer 1: Internet Presence
- **Purpose**: Identify internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure
- **Information Categories**: Domains, subdomains, vHosts, ASN, netblocks, IP addresses, cloud instances, security measures
- **Goal**: Identify all possible target systems and interfaces for testing

### Layer 2: Gateway
- **Purpose**: Understand security protections in place
- **Information Categories**: Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, proxies, NAC, network segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare
- **Goal**: Understand what you're dealing with and what to watch for

### Layer 3: Accessible Services
- **Purpose**: Examine destinations for all services offered
- **Information Categories**: Service type, functionality, configuration, port, version, interface
- **Goal**: Understand system purpose and functionality to effectively communicate with and potentially exploit it

### Layer 4: Processes
- **Purpose**: Identify processes handling commands or functions
- **Focus**: PID, processed data, tasks, source, destination
- **Goal**: Understand relationships and dependencies between processes

### Layer 5: Privileges
- **Purpose**: Identify permissions and privileges of accessible services
- **Information Categories**: Groups, users, permissions, restrictions, environment
- **Goal**: Identify what actions are possible with discovered privileges

### Layer 6: OS Setup
- **Purpose**: Collect information about the operating system with internal access
- **Information Categories**: OS type, patch level, network config, OS environment, configuration files, sensitive private files
- **Goal**: Evaluate system management and identify sensitive internal information

## Important Concepts
- Methodology is not a step-by-step guide but a systematic framework
- Not all discovered gaps/vulnerabilities will lead to successful exploitation
- Time limitations in penetration testing mean 100% certainty of finding all vulnerabilities is impossible
- Specific tools and commands are not part of the methodology itself but constitute a "cheat sheet" for reference

## Notes for Internal Testing
- The first and second layers may not fully apply to internal infrastructure like Active Directory
