# Active Directory Hardening Notes

## Task 1: Introduction
- Active Directory (AD) is critical for managing networks in large organizations.
- This module focuses on applying best cybersecurity practices to harden AD environments.

## Task 2: General Active Directory Concepts
### Important Terms
- **Domain**: The fundamental unit in AD, containing information about network objects.
- **Domain Controller (DC)**: A server that handles authentication and authorization for a domain.
- **Trees and Forests**:
  - **Trees**: Groups of domains that share resources through trust relationships, either one-way or two-way.
  - **Forests**: Collections of trees that share a global catalog and a common directory structure.

### Trust Relationships in AD
- **Trusts**: Allow communication and resource sharing between domains.
  - **Transitive Trusts**: Extend trust automatically between related domains.
  - **Non-Transitive Trusts**: Trust is limited to explicitly defined domains.
  - **One-Way Trusts**: Only one domain trusts the other.
  - **Two-Way Trusts**: Both domains trust each other equally.

### Containers and Leaf Objects
- AD objects can be **containers** (holding other objects) or **leaf objects** (standalone, no child objects).

### Root Domain
- **Root Domain of the attached AD environment**: `tryhackme.loc`

## Task 3: Strengthening Authentication
### Security Settings
- **LAN Manager Hash**: Older, weaker password hashing method; should be disabled.
- **SMB Signing**: Ensures data integrity on the network, protecting against Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks.
- **LDAP Signing**: Requires LDAP communications to be signed to prevent replay attacks and MiTM threats.
- **Password Rotation**: Regular updates are crucial. Best practices include:
  - Automating password changes.
  - Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) for secure automatic password management.

### Password Standards
- **Default Minimum Length**: 7 characters.
- **Recommended Policy Settings**:
  - Enforce password history to prevent reuse.
  - Set a minimum length (10â€“14 characters is advised).
  - Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).

## Task 4: Applying the Least Privilege Model
### Key Principles
- Grant users and systems only the permissions they absolutely need to minimize security risks.
- **Account Types**:
  - **User Accounts**: For regular daily tasks.
  - **Privileged Accounts**: For administrative operations.
  - **Shared Accounts**: Should be avoided when possible due to auditability issues.

### Tiered Access Strategy
- **Tier 0**: Domain Controllers and critical admin accounts.
- **Tier 1**: Servers and applications within the domain.
- **Tier 2**: End-user workstations and general user accounts.

### Quick Checks
- **Should Computers and Printers be added to Tier 0?**: No
- **Should a vendor have a high-privilege account?**: No

## Task 5: Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit
### Implementing Security Baselines
- Install security baselines using Microsoft's Security Compliance Toolkit.
- **BaselineLocalInstall Script**:
  - **Flag**: `THM{00001}`
- **MergePolicyRule Script (Policy Analyzer)**:
  - **Flag**: `{THM00191}`

## Task 6: Defense Against Common Threats
### Major Threats
- **Kerberoasting**: Attackers request service tickets and attempt offline password cracking.
- **Weak Passwords**: Strong password policies help mitigate this risk.
- **RDP Brute Force**: Avoid exposing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) directly to the internet.
- **Public File Shares**: Regularly review and restrict access to network shares.

### Quick Questions
- **Is Kerberoasting an offline password cracking technique?**: Yes
- **How many users share the same password as `aaron.booth`?**: 186

## Task 7: Windows Active Directory Hardening Cheat Sheet
- Securing Active Directory is an ongoing effort requiring cooperation between system admins and users.
- The techniques discussed here form a strong foundation for AD hardening, with future modules diving deeper into Group Policy enforcement and least privilege implementation.
