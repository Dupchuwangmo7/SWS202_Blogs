### Active Directory (AD) Overview Notes

#### What is Active Directory?
- **Definition**: A directory service for Windows network environments, providing centralized management of resources (users, computers, groups, etc.).
- **Structure**: Distributed, hierarchical, scalable, and supports millions of objects per domain.
- **Functions**: Provides authentication and authorization within a Windows domain.

#### Importance of Active Directory
- **Prevalence**: Used by approximately 95% of Fortune 500 companies, making it a significant target for attackers.
- **Vulnerabilities**: AD has been increasingly attacked, with many features not being "secure by default." Misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access.
- **User  Enumeration**: Any user account can enumerate most objects within AD, highlighting the need for proper security measures.

#### Security Concerns
- **Attack Vectors**: Standard domain user accounts can be exploited for lateral and vertical movement within a network.
- **Notable Attacks**: 
  - **noPac Attack**: Exploits vulnerabilities in AD.
  - **Ransomware Targeting**: Ransomware like Conti leverages AD vulnerabilities (e.g., PrintNightmare, Zerologon) for privilege escalation.
- **Defense Strategy**: Emphasizes defense-in-depth, network segmentation, and least privilege access.

#### Active Directory Structure and Function
- **Objects**: Users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, and trusts.
- **Management**: Understanding user rights, privileges, and tools for managing AD is crucial for security professionals.

#### History of Active Directory
- **Origins**: Based on LDAP and X.500 concepts; first introduced in the mid-'90s.
- **Windows Server Integration**: Became part of Windows Server with the release of Windows Server 2000.
- **Key Releases**:
  - **Windows Server 2003**: Introduced Forest feature for managing multiple domains.
  - **Windows Server 2008**: Added Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) for Single Sign-On (SSO).
  - **Windows Server 2016**: Enhanced security features, cloud migration capabilities, and Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA).

#### Ongoing Challenges
- **Misconfigurations**: Common from 2000 to present; new vulnerabilities are regularly discovered.
- **Patching and Security**: Organizations must stay updated on patches and fixes to protect AD environments.

#### Importance for Security Professionals
- **Penetration Testing**: Understanding AD is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and providing remediation advice.
- **Knowledge Application**: A solid foundation in AD fundamentals aids in navigating environments of varying sizes and complexities.

#### Conclusion
- **Active Directory's Role**: Remains a critical component in enterprise environments, even as organizations transition to cloud and hybrid models.
- **Career Relevance**: Knowledge of AD is vital for both attackers and defenders in the cybersecurity field. 

### Key Takeaways
- Active Directory is a crucial directory service with significant security implications.
- Understanding its structure, vulnerabilities, and management is essential for effective security practices.
- Continuous learning and adaptation are necessary to keep up with evolving threats and vulnerabilities in AD environments.
