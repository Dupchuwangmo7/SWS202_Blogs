## Introduction to Active Directory
- Active Directory (AD) plays a vital role in corporate networks by streamlining the management of users and devices.
- It provides centralized control, making it much easier to oversee large networks compared to managing each device separately.

## Room Objectives
- Gain an understanding of what Active Directory is.
- Learn about Active Directory Domains and their components.
- Explore the concepts of forests and domain trusts.

## Windows Domain
- A Windows domain is a network structure where users and computers are managed centrally.
- Active Directory serves as the central system for this management, and the server running AD services is known as a Domain Controller (DC).

### Benefits of a Windows Domain
1. **Centralized Identity Management**: Administrators can manage user accounts from a single console, simplifying oversight.
2. **Security Policy Enforcement**: Network-wide security policies can be easily implemented through AD.

### Real-World Scenario
- In schools or universities, students often use one set of login credentials on multiple devices, thanks to ADâ€™s centralized authentication and policy control.

## Key Components of Active Directory
### Primary Services
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: The core service responsible for maintaining information about all network objects like users, groups, and devices.

### Types of Objects in AD
1. **Users**: Represent individuals or services needing network access, with assigned security permissions.
2. **Machines**: Each computer has a machine account that acts as a security entity with specific access rights.
3. **Security Groups**: Used to collectively manage permissions for multiple users, simplifying access control.

### Organizational Units (OUs)
- OUs are containers used to organize users and devices according to similar policy needs, often reflecting a company's internal structure.

## Managing with Active Directory Users and Computers
- The "Active Directory Users and Computers" tool is used to administer users, groups, and devices.
- OUs can be created to mirror the organization's hierarchy, making policy application more efficient.

### Default System Containers
- **Builtin**: Contains default administrative groups.
- **Computers**: The default location where new domain-joined machines are placed.
- **Domain Controllers**: Stores all domain controllers.
- **Users**: Houses default users and groups for the domain.

## Delegating Administrative Tasks
- Delegation allows specific users to manage particular OUs without requiring full Domain Admin rights, ideal for tasks like resetting passwords.

## Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- GPOs are bundles of settings that can be applied to OUs for system configuration and security enforcement.
- These policies are distributed across the network through the SYSVOL share on Domain Controllers.

### Setting Up GPOs
- GPOs can enforce rules such as disabling Control Panel access or setting mandatory screen lock timers.
- Policies can be linked to specific OUs or the domain as a whole.

## Authentication Mechanisms
### Kerberos
- The default authentication protocol, using ticket-based mechanisms for secure access.
- Users first obtain a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to request service-specific tickets.

### NetNTLM
- An older authentication protocol using a challenge-response method.
- It avoids sending passwords over the network, enhancing security.

## Understanding Trees and Forests
### Trees
- A tree consists of multiple domains sharing the same namespace, like thm.local with subdomains such as uk.thm.local and us.thm.local.

### Forests
- A forest groups multiple trees, which may have distinct namespaces, enabling more flexible management and access between domains.

### Trust Relationships
- Trusts allow users from one domain to access resources in another. These trusts can be one-way or two-way depending on the access requirements.
