# Notes on MySQL

**Overview of MySQL**

- **Definition**: MySQL is an open-source SQL relational database management system developed and supported by Oracle. It is designed for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: MySQL operates on a client-server model, consisting of a MySQL server (the database management system) and one or more MySQL clients that interact with the server.

**MySQL Clients**

- **Functionality**: MySQL clients can perform operations such as inserting, deleting, modifying, and retrieving data using SQL commands.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in dynamic websites and applications, such as WordPress, which stores posts, usernames, and passwords in a MySQL database.

**MySQL Databases**

- **Applications**: MySQL is well-suited for applications requiring high performance and efficient data handling, often used in conjunction with Linux, Apache, and PHP (LAMP stack).
- **Data Storage**: MySQL databases store various types of data, including user information, permissions, and sensitive data, which is typically encrypted before storage.

**MySQL Commands**

- **Command Execution**: MySQL translates commands into executable code, allowing for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Common SQL Commands**:
  - `SHOW DATABASES;`: Lists all databases.
  - `USE <database>;`: Selects a specific database.
  - `SHOW TABLES;`: Lists all tables in the selected database.
  - `SELECT * FROM <table>;`: Retrieves all records from a specified table.

**Default Configuration**

- **Configuration File**: MySQL's default configuration can be found in `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`.
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```bash
  [client]
  port = 3306
  socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

  [mysqld]
  user = mysql
  port = 3306
  datadir = /var/lib/mysql
  ```

**Dangerous Settings**

- **Security Risks**: Misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities, such as exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized access.
- **Key Settings**:
  - `user`: Defines which user the MySQL service runs as.
  - `password`: Sets the password for the MySQL user.
  - `admin_address`: Specifies the IP address for TCP/IP connections.

**Footprinting the Service**

- **Port Scanning**: MySQL typically runs on TCP port 3306. Use Nmap to scan for open MySQL ports and gather information.
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p3306
  ```

- **Example Nmap Output**: Displays open ports, service versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

**Interacting with MySQL Server**

- **Connecting to MySQL**:
  ```bash
  mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <IP address>
  ```

- **Example Commands**:
  - `SHOW DATABASES;`: Displays all databases.
  - `USE <database>;`: Selects a database for further operations.
  - `SHOW TABLES;`: Lists tables in the selected database.

**Conclusion**

- MySQL is a powerful relational database management system that requires careful configuration and management to ensure security and performance. Experimenting with a MySQL server setup can provide valuable insights into its functionality and best practices for securing databases.
