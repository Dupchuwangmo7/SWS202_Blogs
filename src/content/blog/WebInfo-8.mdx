## **DNS Zone Transfers – Notes**

###  What is a Zone Transfer?
- A **DNS Zone Transfer** is a method used to **replicate DNS records** from a primary DNS server to a secondary DNS server.
- It ensures **consistency** and **redundancy** of DNS data across multiple servers.
- **AXFR (Full Zone Transfer)** is the most common type used.

---

### **Zone Transfer Process**
1. **AXFR Request**  
   The secondary server sends a request to the primary server to initiate a zone transfer.

2. **SOA Record Sent**  
   The primary server responds with the **Start of Authority (SOA)** record to validate and compare version numbers.

3. **DNS Records Transfer**  
   All zone records (e.g., A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, TXT) are sent from the primary to the secondary server.

4. **Transfer Complete Signal**  
   A final message indicates the end of the transfer.

5. **Acknowledgement (ACK)**  
   The secondary server confirms successful receipt.

---

###  **Zone Transfer Vulnerability**
- If misconfigured, **unauthorised clients** can request and receive full DNS zone data.
- Originally, zone transfers were **open by default**, but this is now a **security risk**.

####  What an Attacker Gains:
- **Subdomains** – Including hidden/dev/test environments.
- **IP addresses** – Targets for scanning or exploitation.
- **MX and NS records** – Useful for email and infrastructure mapping.

---

### **Remediation**
- **Restrict zone transfers** to only trusted secondary servers using ACLs.
- Use **TSIG** (Transaction Signatures) to authenticate transfers.
- Regularly audit DNS server configurations for misconfigurations.

---

###  **Testing for Zone Transfers**
Use `dig` to attempt a zone transfer:

```bash
dig axfr @<dns-server> <domain>
```

**Example:**
```bash
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

- If successful, you'll see a full list of DNS records.
- `zonetransfer.me` is intentionally misconfigured for educational purposes.

###  **Key Terms**
- **AXFR**: Full zone transfer
- **SOA Record**: Start of Authority – metadata for the zone
- **dig**: A command-line DNS lookup tool
