### Active Directory Groups Overview
- **Purpose**: Groups are used to manage similar users collectively, allowing for mass assignment of rights and access to resources.
- **Target for Attackers**: Groups can confer excessive privileges that may not be apparent, making them a key focus for penetration testers.

### Importance of Group Management
- **Audit Necessity**: Organizations should periodically audit groups to check for excessive memberships and privileges.
- **Difference from OUs**: 
  - **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Used for grouping users, groups, and computers for management and Group Policy deployment.
  - **Groups**: Primarily for assigning permissions to access resources.

### Types of Groups
1. **Security Groups**: 
   - Used to assign permissions and rights to resources.
   - Members inherit permissions assigned to the group.

2. **Distribution Groups**: 
   - Used for email distribution (e.g., in Microsoft Exchange).
   - Cannot be used to assign permissions to resources.

### Group Scopes
1. **Domain Local Group**:
   - Used to manage permissions to resources in the domain where created.
   - Can contain users from other domains but cannot be used in other domains.

2. **Global Group**:
   - Can grant access to resources in other domains.
   - Can only contain accounts from the domain where created.

3. **Universal Group**:
   - Manages resources across multiple domains.
   - Can contain users from any domain and is stored in the Global Catalog.
   - Triggers forest-wide replication when members are added or removed.

### Group Scope Examples
- **Domain Local Groups**: Administrators, Users, Guests, etc.
- **Global Groups**: Domain Computers, Domain Admins, Domain Users, etc.
- **Universal Groups**: Schema Admins, Enterprise Admins.

### Group Scope Conversion Rules
- **Global to Universal**: Allowed if not part of another Global Group.
- **Domain Local to Universal**: Allowed if not containing other Domain Local Groups.
- **Universal to Domain Local**: Allowed without restrictions.
- **Universal to Global**: Allowed if not containing other Universal Groups.

### Built-in vs. Custom Groups
- **Built-in Groups**: Created with a Domain Local Group scope for specific administrative purposes (e.g., Domain Admins).
- **Custom Groups**: Organizations often create additional groups for specific needs, especially when adding services like Microsoft Exchange.

### Nested Group Membership
- **Definition**: Domain Local Groups can be members of other Domain Local Groups, allowing users to inherit privileges indirectly.
- **Risk**: Can lead to unintended privileges; requires careful assessment to uncover.
- **Tools**: BloodHound is useful for visualizing and analyzing nested group memberships and privileges.

### Important Group Attributes
- **cn**: Common Name of the group.
- **member**: List of users, groups, and contacts that are members.
- **groupType**: Specifies the group type and scope.
- **memberOf**: Lists groups that contain this group (nested membership).
- **objectSid**: Unique Security Identifier (SID) for the group.

### Conclusion
- **Fundamental Objects**: Groups are essential for managing rights and access in Active Directory.
- **Knowledge Application**: Understanding group types, scopes, and nested memberships is crucial for effective administration and security assessments.
- **Reconnaissance**: Knowledge of group structures aids in the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing, helping identify potential attack vectors.
