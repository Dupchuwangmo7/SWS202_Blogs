# Notes on NFS (Network File System)

**Overview of NFS**

- **Definition**: Network File System (NFS) is a protocol developed by Sun Microsystems for accessing file systems over a network as if they were local.
- **Compatibility**: Primarily used between Linux and Unix systems; NFS clients cannot communicate with SMB servers.
- **Internet Standard**: Governs procedures in a distributed file system.

**NFS Versions and Features**

- **NFSv2**:
  - Older version, supported by many systems.
  - Operated entirely over UDP.

- **NFSv3**:
  - Introduced variable file sizes and better error reporting.
  - Not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.

- **NFSv4**:
  - Includes Kerberos for authentication.
  - Works through firewalls and on the Internet.
  - No longer requires portmappers.
  - Supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) and state-based operations.
  - First version to have a stateful protocol.

- **NFSv4.1**:
  - Provides support for cluster server deployments (pNFS extension).
  - Includes session trunking (NFS multipathing).
  - Uses a single port (UDP/TCP 2049) for service, simplifying firewall configurations.

**Authentication and Authorization**

- **Mechanism**: NFS relies on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC-RPC/SUN-RPC) protocol.
- **Ports**: Exposed on TCP and UDP ports 111.
- **Authentication**: Shifted to RPC protocol options; relies on UNIX UID/GID and group memberships.
- **Security Note**: Client and server may have different UID/GID mappings, making NFS suitable only for trusted networks.

**Default Configuration**

- **Configuration File**: `/etc/exports` contains a table of filesystems accessible by clients.
- **Example Exports File**:
  ```bash
  # /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
  /srv/homes hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
  ```

- **Options**:
  - `rw`: Read and write permissions.
  - `ro`: Read-only permissions.
  - `sync`: Synchronous data transfer (slower).
  - `async`: Asynchronous data transfer (faster).
  - `secure`: Only ports below 1024 will be used.
  - `insecure`: Allows ports above 1024.
  - `no_subtree_check`: Disables checking of subdirectory trees.
  - `root_squash`: Prevents root from accessing files on an NFS mount.

**Dangerous Settings**

- **rw**: Allows read and write permissions, which can be risky.
- **insecure**: Allows the use of ports above 1024, which can expose the service.
- **no_root_squash**: Keeps files created by root with UID/GID 0, which can lead to security issues.

**Footprinting the Service**

- **Essential Ports**: TCP ports 111 and 2049 are crucial for NFS.
- **Nmap Usage**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
  ```

- **Nmap Output Example**:
  - Shows open ports and running RPC services.

**Mounting NFS Shares**

- **Show Available Shares**:
  ```bash
  showmount -e 10.129.14.128
  ```

- **Mounting Command**:
  ```bash
  mkdir target-NFS
  sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
  ```

- **Accessing Files**: Navigate to the mounted directory to view contents.

**Listing Contents with Usernames & Group Names**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ls -l mnt/nfs/
  ```

- **UID/GID Listing**:
  ```bash
  ls -n mnt/nfs/
  ```

**Escalation and Unmounting**

- **Escalation**: Upload a shell to the NFS share with the SUID of a specific user for further access.
- **Unmounting Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo umount ./target-NFS
  ```

**Conclusion**

- NFS is a powerful tool for file sharing in trusted networks, but it requires careful configuration to avoid security risks. Always test configurations in a controlled environment.
