### Purpose of Host Discovery

- **Objective**: To identify which systems are online and available for interaction during an internal penetration test.
- **Importance**: Understanding the active hosts on a network is crucial for planning further testing and assessments.

### Nmap Host Discovery Options

Nmap provides various options to determine if a target is alive. The most effective method is using ICMP echo requests.

### Storing Scan Results

- **Recommendation**: Always store scan results for comparison, documentation, and reporting purposes. Different tools may yield different results.

### Scanning a Network Range

To scan an entire network range, use the following command:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```

- **Options**:
    - `10.129.2.0/24`: Target network range.
    - `sn`: Disables port scanning (ping scan only).
    - `oA tnet`: Stores results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.

**Example Output**:

```
10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28

```

### Scanning an IP List

If provided with a list of IPs, you can scan them using:

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```

- **Options**:
    - `iL hosts.lst`: Reads hosts from the specified list.

**Example Output**:

```
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20

```

### Scanning Multiple IPs

To scan specific IP addresses:

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```

To scan a range of IPs:

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```

### Scanning a Single IP

To check if a single host is alive:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host

```

- **Output**: Confirms if the host is up and provides the MAC address.

### ICMP Echo Requests

- By default, Nmap uses ARP pings before sending ICMP echo requests. To ensure ICMP echo requests are sent, use:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

```

- **Options**:
    - `PE`: Performs the ping scan using ICMP Echo requests.
    - `-packet-trace`: Displays all packets sent and received.

### Disabling ARP Pings

To disable ARP requests and only use ICMP echo requests:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping

```

### Understanding Host Status

To see why Nmap marked a host as "alive":

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason

```

- **Output**: Displays the reason for the host being marked as up (e.g., received ARP response).

### Conclusion

Host discovery is a critical first step in network penetration testing. Nmap provides various options to effectively identify active hosts on a network, using techniques such as ICMP echo requests and ARP pings. Understanding how to utilize these options and interpret the results is essential for successful network assessments.
