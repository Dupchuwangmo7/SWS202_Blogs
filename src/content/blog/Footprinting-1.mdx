Enumeration Principles in Cybersecurity

## Core Concept
Enumeration is the process of gathering information about targets using both active scans and passive methods, creating a continuous loop of discovery based on previously obtained data.

## Key Distinctions
- Enumeration differs from OSINT (which uses exclusively passive methods)
- The goal is finding all possible paths to systems, not just forcing entry
- Focus should be on understanding infrastructure rather than immediate exploitation

## Common Mistakes
- Immediately attempting brute-force attacks on discovered services
- Focusing only on visible aspects rather than considering what isn't visible
- Causing unnecessary "noise" that triggers security measures

## Guiding Questions
1. What can we see?
2. Why can we see it?
3. What picture does it create?
4. What do we gain from it?
5. How can we use it?
6. What can't we see?
7. Why can't we see it?
8. What picture does what we can't see create?

## Three Core Principles
1. There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
2. Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
3. There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.

## Recommended Approach
Keep these principles and questions visible during assessments to maintain focus on thorough enumeration rather than rushing to exploitation.
