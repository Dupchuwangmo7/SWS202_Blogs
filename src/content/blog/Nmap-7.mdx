# Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) Guide

## Overview

The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a powerful extension of Nmap that allows security professionals to automate network reconnaissance tasks using Lua scripts. NSE enables interaction with various network services, vulnerability assessment, and detailed information gathering that goes beyond basic port scanning.

## Script Categories

NSE scripts are organized into 14 distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **auth** | Determines authentication credentials or methods used by services |
| **broadcast** | Discovers hosts through network broadcasting; discovered hosts can be added to ongoing scans |
| **brute** | Performs brute-force authentication attacks against services |
| **default** | Standard scripts executed with the `-sC` option |
| **discovery** | Evaluates and gathers information about accessible services |
| **dos** | Tests services for denial of service vulnerabilities (used cautiously as it may harm services) |
| **exploit** | Attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities on scanned ports |
| **external** | Utilizes external services for further processing and analysis |
| **fuzzer** | Identifies vulnerabilities through unexpected packet handling (can be time-consuming) |
| **intrusive** | Performs tests that could potentially negatively affect target systems |
| **malware** | Checks if the target system is infected with malware |
| **safe** | Non-intrusive, non-destructive scripts for defensive scanning |
| **version** | Extends service detection capabilities |
| **vuln** | Specifically identifies and reports on vulnerabilities |

## Usage Methods

There are several ways to utilize NSE scripts in Nmap scans:

### Default Scripts

```bash
sudo nmap <target> -sC

```

### Specific Script Category

```bash
sudo nmap <target> --script <category>

```

### Defined Scripts

```bash
sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...

```

### Aggressive Scan

```bash
sudo nmap <target> -A

```

This combines service detection (`-sV`), OS detection (`-O`), traceroute (`--traceroute`), and default NSE scripts (`-sC`).

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Banner Grabbing and SMTP Commands

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

```

**Output:**

```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 23:21 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.050s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_banner: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
|_smtp-commands: inlane, PIPELINING, SIZE 10240000, VRFY, ETRN, STARTTLS, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, 8BITMIME
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

```

This scan reveals:

- The target is running Postfix SMTP server on Ubuntu
- Available SMTP commands that could be used for further enumeration

### Example 2: Aggressive Scan of Web Server

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A

```

**Output:**

```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-17 01:38 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.012s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-generator: WordPress 5.3.4
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: blog.inlanefreight.com
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port

```

This scan reveals:

- Apache 2.4.29 web server running on Ubuntu
- WordPress 5.3.4 is installed
- The website title is "blog.inlanefreight.com"
- High probability (96%) that the target is running Linux

### Example 3: Vulnerability Assessment

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln

```

**Output:**

```
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.036s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

This vulnerability assessment reveals:

- WordPress installation with version 5.3.4
- Detection of admin login page and username "admin"
- Multiple WordPress files that indicate the version
- Apache server vulnerabilities with CVE references and severity scores

## Benefits of NSE

1. **Automation**: Automates complex network reconnaissance tasks
2. **Customization**: Scripts can be customized or new ones created for specific needs
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides detailed information about services, vulnerabilities, and system configurations
4. **Efficiency**: Combines multiple security tools into a single framework
5. **Integration**: Results can be used as input for further testing or incorporated into reports

## Best Practices

1. **Caution with Intrusive Scripts**: Be careful when using scripts from the dos, intrusive, or brute categories as they may impact target systems
2. **Target Permission**: Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any systems
3. **Scan Timing**: Use appropriate timing options to avoid overwhelming target networks
4. **Script Selection**: Choose specific scripts rather than broad categories when possible to minimize scan impact
5. **Output Management**: Save scan results using Nmap's output options for documentation and further analysis

## Conclusion

The Nmap Scripting Engine significantly extends Nmap's capabilities beyond simple port scanning, making it an essential tool for comprehensive network security assessments. By leveraging NSE's extensive script library, security professionals can gather detailed information about network services, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct thorough security evaluations efficiently.
