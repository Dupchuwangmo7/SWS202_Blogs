# Notes on DNS (Domain Name System)

**Overview of DNS**

- **Definition**: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet that translates domain names (e.g., academy.hackthebox.com) into IP addresses, allowing users to access web servers.
- **Decentralized System**: DNS operates without a central database, distributing information across thousands of name servers globally.

**Types of DNS Servers**

1. **DNS Root Server**: 
   - Responsible for top-level domains (TLDs).
   - Acts as a central interface between users and content on the Internet.
   - There are 13 root servers worldwide, coordinated by ICANN.

2. **Authoritative Name Server**: 
   - Holds authority for a specific zone and provides binding answers to queries within its area of responsibility.

3. **Non-authoritative Name Server**: 
   - Collects information on specific DNS zones through recursive or iterative queries but does not hold authority.

4. **Caching DNS Server**: 
   - Caches information from other name servers for a specified duration, improving response times for repeated queries.

5. **Forwarding Server**: 
   - Forwards DNS queries to another DNS server without resolving them locally.

6. **Resolver**: 
   - Performs name resolution locally on a computer or router.

**DNS Security**

- **Unencrypted Protocol**: DNS queries are primarily unencrypted, posing privacy risks. Solutions like DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH), and DNSCrypt provide encryption for DNS traffic.

**DNS Records**

Different DNS records serve various functions, including:

- **A**: Returns an IPv4 address for the requested domain.
- **AAAA**: Returns an IPv6 address for the requested domain.
- **MX**: Specifies the mail servers responsible for the domain.
- **NS**: Lists the DNS servers (nameservers) for the domain.
- **TXT**: Contains various information, such as SPF and DMARC entries for email validation.
- **CNAME**: Serves as an alias for another domain name.
- **PTR**: Performs reverse lookups, converting IP addresses into domain names.
- **SOA**: Provides information about the DNS zone and the administrative contact's email address.

**Default Configuration**

- **Configuration Files**: DNS servers typically use three types of configuration files:
  1. Local DNS configuration files
  2. Zone files
  3. Reverse name resolution files

- **BIND9**: A commonly used DNS server on Linux. Key configuration files include:
  - `named.conf.local`: Defines zones.
  - `named.conf.options`: General settings for the DNS server.

**Zone Files**

- **Structure**: Zone files describe a DNS zone using the BIND file format, containing records like SOA, NS, MX, and A records.
- **Example Zone File**:
  ```bash
  $ORIGIN domain.com
  $TTL 86400
  @ IN SOA dns1.domain.com. hostmaster.domain.com. (
      2001062501 ; serial
      21600 ; refresh
      3600 ; retry
      604800 ; expire
      86400 ) ; minimum TTL
  IN NS ns1.domain.com.
  IN A 10.129.14.5
  ```

**Reverse Name Resolution**

- **Reverse Lookup Files**: Map IP addresses to hostnames using PTR records.
- **Example Reverse File**:
  ```bash
  $ORIGIN 14.129.10.in-addr.arpa
  @ IN SOA dns1.domain.com. hostmaster.domain.com. (
      2001062501 ; serial
      21600 ; refresh
      3600 ; retry
      604800 ; expire
      86400 ) ; minimum TTL
  ```

**Security Considerations**

- **Vulnerabilities**: DNS servers, especially BIND9, can be vulnerable to various attacks. Misconfigurations can lead to security risks.
- **Dangerous Settings**:
  - `allow-query`: Controls which hosts can send requests.
  - `allow-recursion`: Controls which hosts can make recursive requests.
  - `allow-transfer`: Controls which hosts can receive zone transfers.

**Footprinting the Service**

- **Querying DNS Servers**: Use commands like `dig` to query DNS records and gather information about the DNS server.
- **Example Commands**:
  - **NS Query**: 
    ```bash
    dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
    ```
  - **Version Query**: 
    ```bash
    dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85
    ```
  - **ANY Query**: 
    ```bash
    dig any inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
    ```
