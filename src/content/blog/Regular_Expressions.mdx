### **1. Introduction**

Regular Expressions, commonly known as **RegEx**, are powerful tools used for pattern matching in text. They help with searching, replacing, and manipulating data efficiently—especially in tasks like data analysis and configuration inspection.

### **2. What is a Regular Expression?**

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a **search pattern**. These patterns use **metacharacters**—special symbols that provide rules for matching characters.

They are supported in many programming languages and tools such as `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and more.

### **3. Grouping and Operators in RegEx**

<Table data={{
  headers: ["Operator", "Description"],
  rows: [
    ["( )", "Group expressions."],
    ["[ ]", "Character classes. e.g., [a-z]"],
    ["{ }", "Quantifiers. e.g., {1,10}"],
    ["|", "OR operator"],
    [".*", "Match any characters (used like AND)"]
  ]
}} />

### **4. Examples Using `grep` with RegEx**

**OR Operator Example:**

```bash
grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd
