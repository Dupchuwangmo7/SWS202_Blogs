### Value Fuzzing with Ffuf

#### Introduction to Value Fuzzing
After identifying a working parameter, the next step is to fuzz for the correct value that would return the desired content. This process is similar to fuzzing for parameters, but you will need to develop a custom wordlist that contains potential values for the parameter.

#### Creating a Custom Wordlist
When fuzzing for parameter values, you may not always find a pre-made wordlist that works for you. Each parameter expects a certain type of value, and you may need to create your own wordlist based on the parameter you are targeting.

#### Example: Creating a Wordlist for IDs
In this case, you can guess that the `id` parameter accepts a number input. You can create a wordlist containing all numbers from 1-1000 using the following command in Bash:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> ids.txt; done
```

This command writes all numbers from 1-1000 to a file named `ids.txt`.

#### Running the Ffuf Command for Value Fuzzing
You can run the following command to perform value fuzzing:

```bash
ffuf -w ids.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "id=FUZZ"
```

#### Example Output
When you run the command, you may see output similar to this:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\ \ \_\ \ \____/ \ \_\
\/_/ \/_/ \/___/ \/_/
v1.0.2
________________________________________________
:: Method : POST
:: URL : http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php
:: Header : Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
:: Data : id=FUZZ
:: Follow redirects : false
:: Calibration : false

:: Filter : Response size: xxx
________________________________________________
<...SNIP...> [Status: xxx, Size: xxx, Words: xxx]
```

#### Analyzing the Results
- **Identifying the Correct Value**: If you receive a response with a different size or status code, it indicates that the value is correct. You can then use this value to send another POST request using `curl` and collect the flag.

#### Example: Collecting the Flag
Once you have identified the correct value, you can use it to send a POST request using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "id=correct_value" http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php
```

Replace `correct_value` with the value you identified during the fuzzing process.

### Conclusion
Value fuzzing is a crucial step in identifying the correct value for a parameter that would return the desired content. By creating a custom wordlist and using ffuf to fuzz for values, you can identify the correct value and use it to collect the flag. This process requires patience and persistence, but it can lead to significant rewards in terms of identifying vulnerabilities and collecting sensitive information.
