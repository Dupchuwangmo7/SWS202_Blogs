### Importance of Saving Results

- **Purpose**: Saving scan results is crucial for comparing different scanning methods, documenting findings, and reporting.
- **Formats**: Nmap allows saving results in three different formats:
    - **Normal Output**: `oN` (with `.nmap` file extension)
    - **Grepable Output**: `oG` (with `.gnmap` file extension)
    - **XML Output**: `oX` (with `.xml` file extension)
- **Combined Output**: Use `oA` to save results in all formats simultaneously.

### Example Command to Save Results

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

```

- **Options**:
    - `10.129.2.28`: Target IP address.
    - `p-`: Scans all ports.
    - `oA target`: Saves results in all formats with filenames starting with 'target'.

### Resulting Files

After running the command, the following files are created:

```bash
$ ls
target.gnmap target.xml target.nmap

```

### Normal Output

To view the normal output:

```bash
cat target.nmap

```

**Example Output**:

```
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
Host is up (0.053s latency).
Not shown: 4 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open ssh
25/tcp open smtp
80/tcp open http
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)
# Nmap done at Tue Jun 16 12:15:03 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.22 seconds

```

### Grepable Output

To view the grepable output:

```bash
cat target.gnmap

```

**Example Output**:

```
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28
Host: 10.129.2.28 () Status: Up
Host: 10.129.2.28 () Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 25/open/tcp//smtp///, 80/open/tcp//http/// Ignored
# Nmap done at Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.22 seconds

```

### XML Output

To view the XML output:

```bash
cat target.xml

```

**Example Output**:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE nmaprun>
<host starttime="12145301719" endtime="12150323493">
  <status state="up" reason="arp-response"/>
  <address addr="10.129.2.28" addrtype="ipv4"/>
  <ports>
    <port protocol="tcp" portid="22">
      <state state="open" reason="syn-ack"/>
      <service name="ssh"/>
    </port>
    <port protocol="tcp" portid="25">
      <state state="open" reason="syn-ack"/>
      <service name="smtp"/>
    </port>
    <port protocol="tcp" portid="80">
      <state state="open" reason="syn-ack"/>
      <service name="http"/>
    </port>
  </ports>
</host>

```

### Converting XML to HTML

To create a more readable HTML report from the XML output, use the `xsltproc` tool:

```bash
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html

```

- **Result**: The HTML file can be opened in a web browser for a clear and structured presentation of the results.

### Conclusion

Saving Nmap scan results in various formats allows for effective documentation and reporting. The ability to convert XML output to HTML enhances readability, making it easier to share findings with non-technical stakeholders. Understanding how to save and format results is essential for thorough network assessments and audits. For more information on output formats, refer to the Nmap documentation: [Nmap Output Formats](https://nmap.org/book/output.html).
