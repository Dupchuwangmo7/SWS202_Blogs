  Linux file permissions play a crucial role in securing the system and defining who can access or modify resources.

### **Permissions Management**

---

### **1. Introduction**

Linux permissions function like keys, regulating access to files and directories. Every file or directory is owned by a **user** and belongs to a **group**. Permissions dictate what actions each user type (owner, group, others) can perform, enabling secure and organized access to system resources.

---

### **2. File Permissions Overview**

Permissions in Linux are divided into three types:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `r` | Read |
| `w` | Write |
| `x` | Execute (or traverse for directories) |

They are set for three entities:

- **User (owner)**
- **Group**
- **Others**

Example output of `ls -l`:

```bash
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user group 1234 May 4 12:00 example.txt
```

This shows:

- Owner has read, write, execute permissions  
- Group has read, write  
- Others have read only  

---

### **3. Directory Permissions**

- **Read (r)**: View file names in the directory  
- **Write (w)**: Create, delete, or rename files in the directory  
- **Execute (x)**: Traverse or "cd" into the directory  

<Callout emoji="🚫">
  Without execute permission on a directory, users cannot enter it—even if they can see its contents.
</Callout>

Example error message:

```bash
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/script.sh': Permission denied
```

Output from `ls -al` may show `?????????` when permissions are missing.

---

### **4. Numeric Permission Representation**

Permissions can also be represented using **octal notation**:

| Permission | Binary | Octal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rwx | 111 | 7 |
| rw- | 110 | 6 |
| r-- | 100 | 4 |
| r-x | 101 | 5 |

So `chmod 754 file` sets:

- Owner: `rwx` (7)  
- Group: `r-x` (5)  
- Others: `r--` (4)

---

### **5. Modifying Permissions**

Use the `chmod` command:

**Symbolic Method:**

```bash
chmod a+r file     # Add read for all users
chmod g-w file     # Remove write from group
```

**Octal Method:**

```bash
chmod 754 file     # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r--
```

---

### **6. Changing Ownership**

Use `chown` to change the owner and group:

```bash
chown user:group file
```

Example:

```bash
chown root:root shell
```

---

### **7. Special Permissions**

#### 🔸 **SUID (Set User ID)**

- Symbol: `s` in owner's execute position (`rws`)  
- File runs with **owner's** privileges.

#### 🔸 **SGID (Set Group ID)**

- Symbol: `s` in group's execute position  
- File runs with **group's** privileges.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Example: If `journalctl` has SUID and allows shell access, any user could get a root shell — a major risk!
</Callout>

#### 🔸 **Sticky Bit**

- Applies to **directories**  
- Allows only **owners or root** to delete/rename files  
- Symbol: `t` or `T` in the others' execute position

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `t` | Sticky bit set, others **have execute** |
| `T` | Sticky bit set, others **lack execute** |

Example:

```bash
drwxrwxrwt 3 user group 4096 Jan 12 12:30 scripts   # with sticky bit and execute
drwxrwxrwT 3 user group 4096 Jan 12 12:32 reports   # sticky bit without execute
```

### **8. Summary Table**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `r` | Read file or list directory contents |
| `w` | Modify file or directory contents |
| `x` | Execute file or traverse directory |
| `chmod` | Change file/directory permissions |
| `chown` | Change file/directory ownership |
| `SUID` | Execute file as owner |
| `SGID` | Execute file as group |
| `Sticky Bit` | Restricts file deletion in shared directories to file owners |
```
