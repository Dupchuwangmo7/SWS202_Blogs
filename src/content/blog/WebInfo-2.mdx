# WHOIS Protocol - Notes

## Basic Definition
- Query and response protocol to access databases storing internet resource information
- "Phonebook for the internet" - looks up ownership of online assets
- Used for domain names, IP address blocks, and autonomous systems

## Command Example
```

```
Reveals domain registration details, creation dates, etc.

## Typical WHOIS Record Information
- Domain Name (e.g., example.com)
- Registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- Registrant Contact (person/organization that registered domain)
- Administrative Contact (person managing domain)
- Technical Contact (person handling technical issues)
- Creation and Expiration Dates
- Name Servers (servers translating domain names to IP addresses)

## Historical Context
- Created in the 1970s by Elizabeth Feinler and team at Stanford Research Institute's Network Information Center
- Developed for ARPANET (internet precursor)
- Initially tracked network users, hostnames, and domain names

## Importance for Web Reconnaissance
1. **Identifying Key Personnel**:

   - Provides potential targets for social engineering/phishing

2. **Discovering Network Infrastructure**:
   - Provides name servers and IP addresses
   - Helps identify potential entry points or misconfigurations

3. **Historical Data Analysis**:
   - Historical WHOIS records show changes in ownership/contacts
   - Enables tracking of target's digital presence evolution
