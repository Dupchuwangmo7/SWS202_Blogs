### Security in Active Directory Overview
- **Central Management**: Active Directory (AD) is designed for central management and information sharing, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **CIA Triad**: The balance between Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is crucial; AD tends to prioritize Availability and Confidentiality.

### General Active Directory Hardening Measures
1. **Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)**:
   - Randomizes and rotates local administrator passwords on Windows hosts.
   - Reduces the impact of a compromised host.

2. **Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)**:
   - Essential for detecting unauthorized changes or activities.
   - Helps identify attacks such as password spraying or Kerberos attacks.

3. **Group Policy Security Settings**:
   - **Account Policies**: Manage user account interactions (password policies, account lockout).
   - **Local Policies**: Apply security settings specific to computers (user rights assignments, security event audits).
   - **Software Restriction Policies**: Control which software can run on hosts.
   - **Application Control Policies**: Restrict application access for specific users/groups (e.g., using AppLocker).
   - **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration**: Audit activities like file access, logon/logoff events, and privilege usage.

4. **Update Management (SCCM/WSUS)**:
   - Critical for timely patch deployment to minimize vulnerabilities.
   - WSUS and SCCM help automate patch management.

5. **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)**:
   - Provides higher security for service accounts with automatic password management.
   - Allows credentials to be used across multiple hosts without user knowledge.

6. **Security Groups**:
   - Simplifies access management by assigning permissions to groups instead of individual users.
   - Default security groups include Account Operators, Administrators, Domain Admins, etc.

7. **Account Separation**:
   - Administrators should use separate accounts for daily tasks and administrative tasks to limit exposure.
   - Different passwords for each account mitigate risks from password reuse.

8. **Password Complexity Policies + Passphrases + 2FA**:
   - Use strong, complex passwords or passphrases.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points.

9. **Limiting Domain Admin Account Usage**:
   - Domain Admin accounts should only be used on Domain Controllers to reduce attack vectors.

10. **Periodic Auditing and Removing Stale Users and Objects**:
    - Regularly audit AD to disable or remove unused accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.

11. **Auditing Permissions and Access**:
    - Conduct access control audits to ensure users have appropriate access levels.
    - Limit the number of Domain Admins and review local admin rights.

12. **Audit Policies & Logging**:
    - Implement robust logging to detect anomalous activities and potential attacks.

13. **Using Restricted Groups**:
    - Control group membership via Group Policy to limit access to sensitive groups.

14. **Limiting Server Roles**:
    - Avoid installing unnecessary roles on sensitive hosts (e.g., IIS on Domain Controllers) to reduce the attack surface.

15. **Limiting Local Admin and RDP Rights**:
    - Control local admin rights and RDP access to minimize the risk of privilege escalation and data exposure.

### Conclusion
- **Defense-in-Depth**: A comprehensive security strategy is essential for protecting Active Directory.
- **Regular Reviews**: Continuous monitoring, auditing, and updating security measures are critical to maintaining a secure AD environment.
