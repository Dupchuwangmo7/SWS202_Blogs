### Sub-domain Fuzzing with Ffuf

#### Understanding Sub-domains
A sub-domain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, `photos.google.com` is a sub-domain of `google.com`. Sub-domains can host different services or applications, and discovering them can reveal additional resources or functionalities within a web application.

#### Purpose of Sub-domain Fuzzing
Sub-domain fuzzing is used to identify potential sub-domains associated with a target domain. This is done by checking for public DNS records that resolve to valid IP addresses. If a sub-domain exists, it may lead to additional information or vulnerabilities.

#### Required Components for Sub-domain Fuzzing
1. **A Wordlist**: A list of common sub-domain names to test against the target domain.
   - In this case, we will use the wordlist located at `/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomain/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`.

2. **A Target Domain**: The domain you want to test for sub-domains.
   - For this example, we will use `inlanefreight.com`.

#### Running the Sub-domain Fuzzing Scan
To perform the sub-domain fuzzing scan, you can use the following command:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/
```

#### Example Output
When you run the command, you may see output similar to this:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\ \ \_\ \ \____/ \ \_\
\/_/ \/_/ \/___/ \/_/

```

- **Response Codes**: The output shows the HTTP status codes for each request. A **200 OK** indicates that the sub-domain exists and is accessible, while a **301 Moved Permanently** indicates a redirect.
- **Identified Sub-domains**: In this case, you may find sub-domains like `www.inlanefreight.com` and others that return valid responses.

#### Testing Another Domain: `academy.htb`
Next, you can run the same sub-domain fuzzing command on `academy.htb`:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.academy.htb/
```

#### Example Output for `academy.htb`
When you run the command, you may see output similar to this:

```
/'___\ /'___\ /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/ __ __ /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
