# Utilizing WHOIS 
## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Phishing Investigation
- **Context**: Suspicious email claiming to be from company's bank
- **WHOIS findings**:
  - Recent domain registration (days old)
  - Hidden registrant information (privacy service)
  - Name servers linked to bulletproof hosting
- **Outcome**: Clear identification of phishing attempt, domain blocked

### Scenario 2: Malware Analysis
- **Context**: Analyzing malware communicating with C2 server
- **WHOIS findings**:
  - Registration using anonymous free email service
  - Registrant location in country known for cybercrime
  - Registrar with history of lax abuse policies
- **Outcome**: Identification of likely compromised/bulletproof server, hosting provider notified

### Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence Report
- **Context**: Tracking sophisticated threat actor targeting financial institutions
- **WHOIS patterns discovered**:
  - Cluster registration patterns before attacks
  - Various aliases and fake identities
  - Shared name servers across domains
  - History of domain takedowns
- **Outcome**: Created detailed threat actor profile with TTPs and IOCs

## Using WHOIS Command

### Installation
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install whois -y
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
whois facebook.com
```

### Sample Output Analysis for Facebook.com
1. **Domain Registration**:
   - Registrar: RegistrarSafe, LLC
   - Creation Date: 1997-03-29
   - Expiry Date: 2033-03-30
   - Indicates legitimacy and established presence

2. **Domain Owner**:
   - Organization: Meta Platforms, Inc.
   - Contact: Domain Admin

3. **Domain Status**:
   - Multiple protection flags (clientDeleteProhibited, etc.)
   - Indicates strong security measures against unauthorized changes

4. **Name Servers**:
   - All within facebook.com domain (A.NS.FACEBOOK.COM, etc.)
   - Suggests Meta manages its own DNS infrastructure

## Important Considerations
- WHOIS data alone may not identify specific vulnerabilities
- Must be combined with other reconnaissance techniques
- Useful for understanding organization's digital footprint at a high level
