# Web Reconnaissance - Notes

## Introduction
- **Definition**: Systematic collection of information about target websites/applications
- **Purpose**: Serves as preparatory phase before deeper analysis/exploitation
- **Context**: Forms critical part of "Information Gathering" in penetration testing

## Primary Goals
1. **Identifying Assets**:
   - Discover all publicly accessible components
   - Map web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, technologies

2. **Discovering Hidden Information**:
   - Locate exposed sensitive content
   - Find backup files, configuration files, internal documentation

3. **Analyzing Attack Surface**:
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses
   - Assess technologies, configurations, entry points

4. **Gathering Intelligence**:
   - Collect information for exploitation or social engineering
   - Identify personnel, email addresses, behavior patterns

## Types of Reconnaissance

### Active Reconnaissance
- **Definition**: Direct interaction with target system to gather information

| Technique | Description | Example Tools | Risk of Detection |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Port Scanning | Identify open ports/services | Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan | High |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Probe for known vulnerabilities | Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto | High |
| Network Mapping | Map target's network topology | Traceroute, Nmap | Medium-High |
| Banner Grabbing | Get information from service banners | Netcat, curl | Low |
| OS Fingerprinting | Identify operating system | Nmap, Xprobe2 | Low |
| Service Enumeration | Determine service versions | Nmap | Low |
| Web Spidering | Crawl website structure | Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider | Low-Medium |

- **Advantage**: More comprehensive view of target
- **Disadvantage**: Higher risk of detection

### Passive Reconnaissance
- **Definition**: Gathering information without direct interaction

| Technique | Description | Example Tools | Risk of Detection |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Search Engine Queries | Use search engines to find information | Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Shodan | Very Low |
| WHOIS Lookups | Query domain registration details | whois command-line tool, online services | Very Low |
| DNS Analysis | Examine DNS records | dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum | Very Low |
| Web Archive Analysis | Review historical website snapshots | Wayback Machine | Very Low |
| Social Media Analysis | Gather info from social platforms | LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook | Very Low |
| Code Repositories | Analyze public code repos | GitHub, GitLab | Very Low |

- **Advantage**: Stealthier approach, unlikely to trigger alerts
- **Disadvantage**: May yield less comprehensive information

## Module Focus
- Will explore essential tools and techniques for web reconnaissance
- Starting with WHOIS protocol for domain registration information
- Builds foundation for more advanced reconnaissance methods
