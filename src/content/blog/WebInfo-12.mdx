### **Crawling (Spidering)**  
Crawling is the automated, systematic process of browsing the web to collect data by following links from one page to another.

---

### **How Crawlers Work**
- **Start Point**: Begins with a **seed URL** (starting webpage).
- **Process**:
  1. Fetch the page.
  2. Parse and extract links.
  3. Add extracted links to a queue.
  4. Repeat the process on new links.

---

### **Example**
- Homepage → Contains `link1`, `link2`, `link3`
- Visiting `link1` → Reveals `Homepage`, `link2`, `link4`, `link5`
- The crawler continues to discover new pages recursively.

---

### **Crawling Strategies**
1. **Breadth-First Crawling**
   - Explores all links at the current level before going deeper.
   - Good for: Website structure overview.

2. **Depth-First Crawling**
   - Follows one path down as far as possible before backtracking.
   - Good for: Deeply nested content discovery.

---

### **Data Extracted by Crawlers**
- **Internal & External Links**: Map structure, discover hidden pages, relationships.
- **Comments**: May contain sensitive or insider info (e.g., software versions, bugs).
- **Metadata**: Includes titles, descriptions, keywords, author info—useful for context.
- **Sensitive Files**:
  - Backup: `.bak`, `.old`
  - Config: `web.config`, `settings.php`
  - Logs: `error_log`, `access_log`
  - Credentials or secrets may be exposed.

---

### **Importance of Context in Crawling**
- Data must be **analyzed holistically**.
- Seemingly unimportant details (like a comment) can become valuable when correlated.
- Example:
  - Directory `/files/` discovered.
  - Crawling shows directory browsing is enabled.
  - Files like backups or documents are accessible.
  - Comments may reference services or files, confirming the exposure.

### **Use in Reconnaissance**
- Crawling helps **enumerate targets**, uncover **hidden resources**, and identify **weaknesses**.
- When paired with other techniques (e.g., fingerprinting), it enhances **situational awareness** of the target.
