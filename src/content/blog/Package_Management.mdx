# Package Management

### ðŸ”¹ **What Are Packages?**

- Bundles of software including:
    - Binaries
    - Config files
    - Dependency information
    - Update/upgrade tracking

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Why Package Management Matters**

- Handles installation, updates, and removal of software
- Resolves dependencies automatically
- Maintains consistency across systems
- Prevents version conflicts

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Common Linux Package Managers & Tools**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dpkg` | Installs/removes `.deb` files (low-level tool) |
| `apt` | High-level tool for managing Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu, Parrot OS) |
| `aptitude` | Alternative to `apt`, often with a more interactive interface |
| `snap` | Installs Snap packages (sandboxed software) |
| `gem` | Ruby's package manager |
| `pip` | Python package manager |
| `git` | Used to clone/download projects from Git repositories |

---

### ðŸ”¹ **APT in Action**

```bash
# Search for packages
apt-cache search impacket

# View package details
apt-cache show impacket-scripts

# List all installed packages
apt list --installed

# Install a package with automatic "yes"
sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y

```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Working With Git**

```bash
# Create folder and clone a Git repo
mkdir ~/nishang/
git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang/

```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Install .deb Files Manually**

1. Download with `wget`:

```bash
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

```

1. Install using `dpkg`:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

```

1. Confirm it works:

```bash
strace -h

```

### ðŸ§  **Tips**

- Always use `apt` over `dpkg` when possibleâ€”it handles dependencies automatically.
- Update your APT repo lists regularly with `sudo apt update`.
- Check which repos your system uses via `/etc/apt/sources.list` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
